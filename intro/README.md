##  What is Machine Learning?

Machine Learning enables systems to learn patterns from data to make predictions or decisions without being explicitly programmed. For example, predicting a car's price involves training a model using features like year and mileage (input) and the car's price (target). The trained model can then predict prices for unseen cars.

In ML, data is split into:

* **Features (X):** Descriptive attributes of the object.
* **Target (y):** The value to be predicted.

The model learns from the relationship between `X` and `y` and uses this to predict targets for new data.

##  ML vs Rule-Based Systems

A comparison is made using a **spam filter** example:

* **Rule-Based Systems:** Rely on manually defined rules (e.g., keywords), which require continuous updates and are difficult to scale.
* **ML-Based Systems:** Use historical data (e.g., labeled spam/non-spam emails) to extract features, train models, and make probabilistic predictions. This approach is more adaptive and maintainable.

Steps:

1. **Data Collection:** Gather labeled examples (e.g., from inbox and spam folder).
2. **Feature Engineering:** Extract meaningful attributes from emails.
3. **Model Training:** Train a classifier to predict spam likelihood.
4. **Thresholding:** Classify emails based on probability and a defined threshold.

##  Supervised Machine Learning (SML)

SML involves labeled data: the model is trained on input-output pairs.

* **Feature Matrix (X):** Rows = observations, Columns = features.
* **Target Vector (y):** Corresponding output for each observation.

The model is trained as a function `g(X)` ≈ `y`.

### Types of SML:

* **Regression:** Predicts numerical values (e.g., price).
* **Classification:** Predicts categories (e.g., spam or not).

  * *Binary*: Two classes.
  * *Multiclass*: More than two.
* **Ranking:** Predicts order or relevance scores (e.g., in recommendation systems).

##  CRISP-DM Methodology

**CRISP-DM** (Cross-Industry Standard Process for Data Mining) is a widely adopted framework for ML projects:

1. **Business Understanding:** Define measurable goals and assess the need for ML.
2. **Data Understanding:** Explore and analyze the available data sources.
3. **Data Preparation:** Clean and transform data into a usable format.
4. **Modeling:** Train multiple models and optimize feature selection.
5. **Evaluation:** Measure performance and ensure alignment with business goals.
6. **Deployment:** Integrate the model into production with continuous monitoring.

*Note: ML projects are iterative—start simple, gather feedback, and improve continuously.*

##  Model Selection & Evaluation

When choosing a model (e.g., Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Neural Network):

* Use separate datasets:

  * **Training Set:** For learning.
  * **Validation Set:** For tuning.
  * **Test Set:** For final evaluation.
  * Typical split: 60% Train / 20% Validation / 20% Test.

**Workflow:**

1. Train multiple models on training data.
2. Evaluate on the validation set.
3. Select the best-performing model.
4. Retrain on combined Train+Validation data.
5. Evaluate final performance on the test set.

This ensures generalization and guards against the **Multiple Comparisons Problem (MCP)**—where a model may appear good just by chance.
