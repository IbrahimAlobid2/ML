#  Python Data Foundations: NumPy, Linear Algebra & Pandas

This Notebooks offers a hands-on introduction to fundamental Python libraries and concepts essential for data science and machine learning workflows.

---

##  NumPy Essentials

NumPy (Numerical Python) is a core library for numerical computing. The section covers:

* Creating 1D & 2D arrays with `np.array()`, `np.zeros()`, `np.ones()`, and `np.linspace()`.
* Indexing, slicing, and reshaping arrays.
* Performing mathematical and comparison operations.
* Working with random numbers and statistical summaries.

##  Linear Algebra Refresher (with NumPy)

Covers the mathematical operations essential in ML:

* **Vector operations** (addition, scalar multiplication)
* **Dot product** between vectors
* **Matrix-vector** and **matrix-matrix multiplication**
* Use of **identity matrices** and **matrix inversion** via `np.linalg.inv()`

Each concept is accompanied by clean, functional Python code implementations.

##  Introduction to Pandas

Pandas simplifies data analysis and manipulation. Covered topics include:

* Creating `DataFrame` and `Series` objects
* Indexing and accessing rows/columns using `.loc[]` and `.iloc[]`
* Element-wise operations, filtering, and conditional queries
* Handling missing values
* Grouping and aggregation (e.g., using `.groupby()`)
* String manipulation and column normalization
* Exporting data and working with underlying NumPy arrays

---

###  Bonus Topics

* Handling missing data with `.isnull()` and `.sum()`
* Renaming and modifying indexes
* Data summarization with `.describe()`, `.mean()`, `.nunique()`
* Exporting DataFrames as Python dictionaries
